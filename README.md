## Objective

The development of this Scrapy program serves as an alternative (project/tool) when it comes to scraping webpages to easily pull useful information. The targeted webpage contains information on public holidays in the country of Malaysia.

## Methodology and framework

Scrapy is a useful tool when it comes to webscraping and how it differs over other options such as BeautifulSoup or Selenium is the different built-in features and functions within the framework. Some of the advantages that key between one user's choice of approach are:

-   Asynchronous capabilities allowing multiple pages to be loaded in parallel to speed up the scraping process
-   Different settings that allow users to adjust the crawler to fit certain limitations/constraints of a target webpage you intend to scrape.

## Learnings and potential improvements

This project is a simpler development as compared to some more complex programs that can be developed to tackle more challenging webpages. Some of the possible future works could be done are:

-   Scraping product pages on e-commerce websites with the "follow link" feature, enabling the crawler to exhaustively scrape all available pages.
-   Parallel scraping to speed up data pipelines.
